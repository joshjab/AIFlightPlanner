- Use `pytest` to run backend tests.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Setup Python Backend Project with FastAPI
  - [x] 1.1 Initialize a new Python project in a `backend` directory with a virtual environment (`venv`).
  - [x] 1.2 Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and `python-dotenv`.
  - [x] 1.3 Create the initial project structure: `main.py`, and directories for `services`, `core`, `tests`, `models`.
  - [x] 1.4 Create a simple `/health` endpoint in `main.py` to confirm the FastAPI application is running correctly.
- [ ] 2.0 Implement External Data Acquisition Layer
  - [x] 2.1 In `services/weather_service.py`, create a function to fetch METARs and TAFs from the Aviation Weather Center (AWC) API.
  - [x] 2.2 In `services/notam_service.py`, implement web scraping for NOTAMs from notams.aim.faa.gov:
    - [x] 2.2.1 Set up proper request headers and session management
    - [x] 2.2.2 Implement form data submission for NOTAM search
    - [x] 2.2.3 Parse JSON response to extract structured NOTAM data
    - [x] 2.2.4 Add retry logic and error handling for network issues
  - [ ] 2.3 In `services/weather_service.py`, add a function to fetch enroute weather warnings.
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement robust error handling and rate limiting in all service functions.
  - [ ] 2.5 In `tests/test_services.py`, write unit tests with mocked responses.
  - [ ] 2.6 Enhance weather service to include parsed weather data and flight category determination.
- [ ] 3.0 Implement Caching and Data Persistence
  - [x] 3.1 In `database.py`, set up the SQLAlchemy engine and session management for a SQLite database.
  - [X] 3.2 In `schemas.py`, define the table schema for storing airport data (e.g., name, elevation, runways, weather, NOTAMs).
  - [X] 3.3 Enhance the `populate_airport_data.py` script to:
    - Download airport data from OurAirports.
    - Use the `weather_service` and `notam_service` to fetch initial weather and NOTAM data for each airport.
    - Populate the database with the combined airport, weather, and NOTAM data.
  - [ ] 3.4 In `services/airport_service.py`, create a function to retrieve airport details (including weather and NOTAMs) from the database.
  - [x] 3.5 Implement a caching layer for external API responses to minimize redundant calls.
  - [ ] 3.6 In `tests/test_services.py`, write unit tests for the `airport_service` functions.
  - [ ] 3.7 Implement sophisticated cache invalidation strategy with different TTLs for different data types.
- [ ] 4.0 Develop Go/No-Go Recommendation Engine
  - [x] 4.1 In `models.py`, define the Pydantic model for pilot preferences received in the API request.
  - [x] 4.2 Create a new `services/recommendation_service.py` to house the Go/No-Go logic.
  - [x] 4.3 Implement the rules-based engine for Go/No-Go decisions.
  - [x] 4.4 Generate human-readable reasons for recommendations.
  - [x] 4.5 In `tests/test_services.py`, write unit tests for the `recommendation_service`.
  - [X] 4.6 Implement weather minimums validation based on flight rules (VFR/IFR).
  - [ ] 4.7 Create route-based weather analysis functionality.
- [ ] 5.0 Build and Integrate Frontend with `/api/briefing` Endpoint
  - [ ] 5.1 In `main.py`, define the `GET /api/briefing` endpoint.
  - [ ] 5.2 In the endpoint logic, orchestrate calls to all services.
  - [ ] 5.3 Structure the JSON response for the frontend.
  - [ ] 5.4 In `tests/test_main.py`, write integration tests.
  - [ ] 5.5 Update `BriefingDisplay.jsx` to use live data.
