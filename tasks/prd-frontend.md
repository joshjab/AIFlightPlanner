# Product Requirements Document: Flight Planner Frontend

## 1. Introduction/Overview
The Flight Planner frontend is a minimal, mobile-friendly web application designed for licensed pilots. Its primary goal is to enable rapid, easy pre-flight planning by allowing pilots to enter departure and destination airports, receive a quick go/no-go decision based on their preferences and route data, and interact with an AI assistant for further questions. The interface prioritizes ease of use, speed, and clarity, with a strict focus on essential features and a dark-themed, modern look.

## 2. Goals
- Allow pilots to enter departure and destination airports quickly and easily.
- Provide a go/no-go decision in under 15 seconds (assuming fast backend/API/LLM response).
- Present all relevant route, weather, and NOTAM data in a clear, organized manner.
- Enable pilots to set and save personal preferences (e.g., crosswind limits, home base, aircraft type).
- Ensure the interface is mobile-friendly, minimal, and dark-themed.
- Strictly validate ICAO codes before allowing queries.
- Handle API failures gracefully with clear user feedback.

## 3. User Stories
- As a pilot, I want to rapidly select my departure and destination airports so I can plan my flight efficiently.
- As a pilot, I want to receive a go/no-go decision based on my preferences, aircraft, and route data so I can make informed decisions quickly.
- As a pilot, I want to save my preferences (aircraft, home base, personal minimums) so I donâ€™t have to re-enter them each time.
- As a pilot, I want to interact with an AI assistant via chat to ask follow-up questions about my flight plan.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide dropdowns or searchable selects for departure and destination ICAO codes, only allowing valid codes from the database.
2. The system must include a "Surprise Me" button that suggests a destination based on user preferences and aircraft type.
3. The system must display a briefing package (route, weather, NOTAMs, airport info) after route selection.
4. The system must show a clear go/no-go recommendation with reasons, based on pilot preferences and route data.
5. The system must include a modal or section for pilots to set and save preferences (crosswind limits, home base, aircraft type), stored in localStorage.
6. The system must present an "Acknowledge Briefing" button, disabled until all data is reviewed, which must be clicked before enabling further chat interaction.
7. The system must provide a chat interface for pilots to ask follow-up questions after acknowledging the briefing.
8. The system must validate ICAO codes strictly before allowing any backend/API queries.
9. The system must display clear error messages and fallback UI in case of API failures or data unavailability.
10. The system must be fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.
11. The system must use a dark theme and maintain a minimal, modern look and feel.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No support for non-licensed pilots or instructors.
- No chair flying simulation in the initial version.
- No advanced map visualizations or route drawing (textual/summary only).
- No real backend/API integration (all data mocked for now).
- No user authentication or account system.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- The UI should use dropdowns or searchable selects for ICAO code entry, with typeahead and validation.
- The chat interface should be simple, with clear separation from the main planning workflow.
- All UI elements should be touch-friendly and accessible on small screens.
- Use a dark color palette with high contrast for readability.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Use the simplest frontend stack that enables a modern, attractive UI (e.g., React with a minimal component library, or plain HTML/CSS/JS with a lightweight framework if preferred).
- All data should be mocked or stubbed for now; no real API calls.
- Store pilot preferences in browser localStorage.
- Ensure strict ICAO code validation using a static list or mock database.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Pilots can complete a flight plan and receive a go/no-go decision in under 15 seconds (excluding network/LLM delays).
- 100% of ICAO code entries are valid before query.
- 100% of API failures are handled with clear, user-friendly error messages.
- The interface is fully usable and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 9. Open Questions
- Should the "Surprise Me" feature allow for additional filters (e.g., distance, direction) in the future?
- Are there any branding or logo requirements for the initial version?
- Should the chat interface support file/image uploads in the future?
- What is the preferred method for mocking backend data (static JSON, in-memory objects, etc.)?
